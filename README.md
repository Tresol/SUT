# SUT: A Short Description

Do you know what is SUT?

SUT refers to the repository called Some Useful Tools, which stores some useful tools I have used in my computer. It owns a GitHub page at [SUT](http://tresol.github.io/SUT/).

I hope the tools in the repository will help you. Also, it will be appreciated if you fork and star my repository.

## Goals

My goal for the long term is to build a software that collects a lot of useful gargets and release it in GitHub.

The goal for the following couple of days, is just to collect more tools and design a better github page for it.

Anyway, my time is limited and the repository is created only out of my interest.
